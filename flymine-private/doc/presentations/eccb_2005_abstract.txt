InterMine (www.intermine.org) is a general purpose, object-oriented data warehouse system developed as part of the FlyMine project (www.flymine.org).  It enables simple, configurable integration of data from multiple sources and storage in a query-optimised data warehouse.  Users are able to create powerful, arbitrary queries using an intuitive web application or an object based query language.

InterMine is model independent, all model specific components are automatically generated from a single XML file.  The system enables integration of multiple data models in various formats (UML, XML Schema and DAG) and can incorporate data from relational databases, XML and flat files.  

A generic query optimisation system means that InterMine can turn any model into a query optimised data warehouse.  Incoming queries are automatically analysed and re-written to use pre-computed tables in the underlying database.  Generation of pre-computed tables is configurable, thus the system can be optimised for any user query and performance can adapt to actual usage. 

The model independent web application is designed to be a powerful query tool giving users the ability to build complex queries and not be constrained by fill-in-the-blanks forms.  Queries and collections of results can be saved between sessions.  It is also simple to create and publish templates to make common queries easy to run.

FlyMine defines a biological data model for InterMine and code/configuration to integrate a number of standard data formats - for example Ensembl, MAGE (microarrays), PSI (protein interactions), UniProt and GO assignments.  FlyMine is aimed at Drosophila and Anopheles research but has many generic components that can be re-used for other biological data warehouses.  T1DMine is currently in beta stage, integrating genomic and genetic information relevant to Type 1 diabetes.
