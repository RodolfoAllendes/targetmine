    <title>Contributing code to the InterMine project</title>

    <para>We warmly welcome contributions to the project, however big or
    small. If you would like to get involved, the best thing to do is talk to
    existing developers via the flymine-dev mailing list, to prevent
    unnecessary duplication of work.</para>

    <para>We prefer to accept patches against the current CVS repository. All
    code must adhere to the <ulink url="coding-standards.xml">InterMine coding
    standards</ulink> (note specifically that every method of every class must
    have comprehensive unit tests), and not cause any existing unit tests to
    fail.</para>
