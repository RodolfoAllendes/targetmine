    <title>The following positions are currently vacant on the FlyMine project:</title>

    <para>Computer Officer Grade II (Software Development)</para>

    <para>Salary: GBP 30,362 - GBP 32,666</para> 
    <para>Limit of tenure: 30 April 2007 *</para>

    <para>We are looking for a bio-informatics software developer to join a Wellcome Trust funded project integrating functional genomics data from the model organisms Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae.</para>

    <para>FlyMine (<ulink url="http://www.flymine.org">www.flymine.org</ulink>) is a freely available resource providing a powerful Web interface for researchers to perform complex queries over a wide range of genomic and proteomic data sets.  In building FlyMine we have developed InterMine (<ulink url="http://www.intermine.org">www.intermine.org</ulink>) - a data model independent, object-based data integration and query system with a sophisticated Struts/JSP web application.  As a team, the software developers are responsible for designing, coding, testing and importing data into the system, many parts of which are technically challenging.  We work with Java and XML with a PostgreSQL backend, in a Unix/Linux environment.  All of our code is freely available under an open source licence.</para>

    <para>You will be involved in all aspects of the system including design, coding and especially data modelling and dataflow.  Experience and interest in manipulating biological data are essential.  You will have at least 1 years experience developing software in a small team environment, Java would be an advantage as would experience with SQL/OQL, XML and object/relational mapping.</para>

    <para>Funds for this post are available until 30 April 2007 in the first instance, and the post may, subject to availability of funding, be renewed for a further period or periods.</para>
