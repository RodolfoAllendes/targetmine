<title>Biologist - Database analysis and user support (MATERNITY COVER)</title>

<para>Salary: £35,254 - £39,452 pa</para>

<para>Limit of tenure: Up to one year*</para>

<para>A temporary maternity cover position has become available within the FlyMine project and is available on a full-time or part-time basis (<ulink url="http://www.flymine.org">www.flymine.org</ulink>). This post is immediately available. FlyMine is an open source project being developed in the Department of Genetics to build an integrated database of genomic, gene expression and protein data for Drosophila, Anopheles and other insects. Currently such data are available from disparate sources in many different formats making querying across them difficult. The aim of FlyMine is to incorporate much of these data into a single, integrated database and make it available online. A sophisticated web application permits researchers to construct arbitrary, complex queries across the data allowing comparisons and inferences to be made. Access is also possible using a library of pre-defined 'template' queries and browsable reports.</para>

<para>We seek a proactive, experienced biologist to join the team as maternity cover. The position requires working closely with software developers and supporting end-users.</para>

<para>Key areas of work will include:</para>
<itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>Biological support for the software developers - providing information about data sources to be loaded and how they should be modelled in a biologically intuitive way.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Analysis of the modelled data and advising on new user interface features</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Expanding the library of pre-defined queries to take full advantage of the integrated data</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Providing documents and training for end-users in the form of a user manual, tutorials and running workshops locally and at conferences.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Working with users to make sure they are able to extract the information they require and assisting them with analysis of data</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Providing feedback to the software developers about usage and data requirements, and helping to set development priorities</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
The successful candidate is likely to have a PhD in a biological or related field, broad knowledge of genomics, proteomics and current high-throughput biological techniques, experience of working with post-genomic biological data in a bioinformatics environment and of extracting information from biological databases, and interest in data modelling for biological databases and familiarity with biological ontologies and data standards (e.g. SO, GO, MAGE, PSI). Some programming experience (particularly in Perl or Java) would be ideal and experience in Drosophila biology would be an advantage but is not essential
