    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>With the completion of increasing numbers of genome sequences has
    come an explosion in the development of both computational and
    experimental high-throughput techniques for deciphering the functions of
    molecules and their interactions. However, many of these data are noisy
    and stronger inferences can be made if one is able to combine data from
    different sources. Currently, biological data are stored in a wide variety
    of formats in numerous different places, making complex queries across
    these data sources hard. One of the current challenges for bioinformatics
    is therefore to develop resources for the integration and combined
    analysis of such data. The FlyMine project is an open-source project to
    build an integrated database of genomic, expression and proteomics data
    for Drosophila, Anopheles and other insects.</para>

    <para>The FlyMine database is built using <ulink
    url="http://www.intermine.org">InterMine</ulink>, an open-source data
    warehouse system for integrating the data from many sources into one
    object-based database. The FlyMine data model is generated by merging
    existing and emerging ontologies and standards (e.g. MAGE, SO, PSI), thus
    enabling data to be loaded from a variety of sources and providing the
    flexibility to easily incorporate new data sources as they appear. A
    powerful and flexible query interface to these data enables users to
    perform arbitrary and complex queries across the data either via a web
    interface or a programming interface. The web interface enables users to
    build queries, by combining classes of objects and applying constraints to
    their attributes. Queries and sets of results can be saved for use in
    further queries or for feeding to analysis programs. The result display
    includes links to external databases, class and attribute browsing
    capability as well as the ability to select data for download in a variety
    of formats. Display and analysis tools will be available soon. Help is
    available through query examples, on-line help pages and an analysis
    support help-desk.</para>

    <para>The first release of FlyMine includes genome annotation data for
    Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, yeast 2-hybrid data for D.
    melanogaster and C. elegans, and orthologue/ paralogue data relating the
    genes of these organisms. The inclusion of Caenorhabditis elegans
    orthologues also gives access to C. elegans RNAi phenotypes. Development
    of the database is currently rapid. We aim to add new functional genomics
    data sources and increase coverage to further insects as data become
    available, as well as maintaining continued development of the web
    interface and analysis tools. We hope that FlyMine will become a valuable
    data mining tool for the insect genomics community.</para>
